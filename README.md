# Sports Analysis: In football is home field advantage really the stadium or the fans? 

## Abstract
Through this project, we studied the impact of fans in premier league matches. The impact of fans needs to be quantified in order to analyse it statistically. For this we analysed the match summaries and standings collected from the premier league website.

## Data source
The original data was obtained from [this repository](https://github.com/bicachu/EPL-fans-presence-experiment/blob/main/data/premier_league_matches.csv) 
The two seasons in consideration are 2019-20 and 2020-21 (entire season's data not considered)

## Hypotheses tested

* The presence of fans makes a difference in the final result of the game.
* The presence of fans helps home teams to win more points from losing positions.
* The presence of fans makes a difference in the game style of teams (ex. Possession, shots attempted, shots on target, goals scored, etc.)
* The presence of fans puts more pressure on the referee to make more calls in favour of the home team
* Presence of fans helps the home teams to score more in the dying moments of the game, as they are more vocal at these times in tight games
